    <h2>Writeup</h2>
    <blockquote><pre>
        Step into the inferno ring where the beats are like the ticking clock, driving
        you toward destiny. Feel the pulsating energy of the pit as your every move
        becomes a testament to skill and courage, synchronization reigning
        supreme. Amidst the hustle, aggression, and intensity shall hold the key to
        Exodus. Pinfall? or Eternal Glory? Only time will tell……
