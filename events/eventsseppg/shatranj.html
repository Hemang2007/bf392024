    <h2>Writeup</h2>
    <blockquote><pre>
        “It’s not over until I win.”
        From Vedic ‘Chaturanga’ to Modern-day ‘Blitz’, from Garry Kasparov and Bobby
        Fischer to Magnus Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura, engage your brains in this
        ever-evolving game of kings, queens, knights and pawns. Sacrifice your rook and
        lose the battle to either win the war or fall prey to your opponent’s cunning as
        Yudhishthir fell to Duryodhan millennia ago. Do you have the potential to be the
        next grandmaster?

    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <pre>
        Participants: 4

        1.	The tournament will be of 5 rounds, as per FIDE Swiss League System. Round 1 fixtures shall be decided by a Lottery System. 
        2.	After Round 1, the teams with the same scores shall play each other (Lottery will be done as and when required). 
        3.	A draw by mutual agreement can only occur if there are no major pieces left on both sides and only pawns and Kings remain or
         a King/Queen vs. King/Queen situation occurs. No other types of draws shall be accepted.
        4.	 All FIDE rules need to be duly followed. 
        5.	The participants cannot walk in and out of the rooms where the competition is being held. It is the responsibility of the participants
         to ensure that when they are participating in chess, they are not expected to report for some other event. There shall be no exceptions in this regard.
        6.	 The faintest hint of aggression and use of unparliamentary language, either towards the opponent or the teachers/organisers of 
        the games shall lead to immediate disqualification of the team.
        7.	 The decision of the organisers will be considered final and binding in all cases.
