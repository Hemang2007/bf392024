    <h2>Writeup</h2>
    <blockquote><pre>
        Gear up for a musical time-travel extravaganza. If Ed Sheeran can groove to
        Punjabi beats and Enrique Iglesias can serenade in Hindi, then why not join us in
        diving into the kaleidoscopic universe of Bollywood melodies? From the timeless
        classics of 'Chalte Chalteâ€™ to the foot-tapping beats of 'Chikni Chameli,' let's
        journey through the eras of melody. It's a rendezvous where the past, present, and
        future collide in a harmonious symphony of tunes.
