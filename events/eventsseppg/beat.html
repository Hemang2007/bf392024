        “The man that hath no music in himself, Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;
        Let no such man be trusted” - Shakespeare

        From 80s rock icons to modern-day death metal, we're spanning the ages for an

        to Top Trending on Spotify, it's all happening here. Let's get some catchy tunes
        stuck in our head and aspire to be this generations' Beatles or Nirvana.
