    <h2>Writeup</h2>
    <blockquote><pre>
        Imagine sitting on the edge of your seat, holding your breath as the sun takes its
final bow, casting a golden glow that could rival the best scenes from your favorite
flicks. It's like a classic movie moment, etching itself into your mind. It's just you,
your lens, and patience, so go ahead and capture all you can from the infinite glory
of time.
