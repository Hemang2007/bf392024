        1 minute, 60 seconds, Infinite possibilities.
You only get one shot, one chance to make your mark on history and either be
eternally immortalized or instantaneously forgotten. Every passing second in this
event is a chance to turn it all around. Race against the ruthless sands of time and
emerge victorious in this grand vesture. So ‘Carpe Diem’, my friends.
