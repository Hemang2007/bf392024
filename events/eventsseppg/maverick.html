        The first rule of fight club is that… there are no rules??
        As Dante said, 'Abandon all hope ye who enter' for once you take a step into this
        hellish realm of confusion and absolute lawlessness, there is no going back. Even
        the laws of physics are scared of this vortex of madness where anything and
        everything goes. So, do you dare to gamble your sanity for a shot at glory?
