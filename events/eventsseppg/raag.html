    <h2>Writeup</h2>
    <blockquote>
        Enter into a timeless realm where the soul of Carnatic music whispers through the
        air. In this sanctum of tradition, powerful raagas command the very forces of
        nature and the melodious notes of the flute bring the universe to a standstill. From
        the tabla and sitar to the iktara and sarangi, pick your instrument of passion and
        join us in this celebration of Eastern music where every note carries the weight of
        centuries past and the promise of eternity for the next Taansen or Ravi Shankar.
