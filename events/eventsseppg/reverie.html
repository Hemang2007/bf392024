    <blockquote><pre>
        Get your ‘time machine’ and step into a new timeline where the past, present and
        future converge in a symphony of prose crafting. Let us embark on a creative
        writing extravaganza and get Doraemon’s ‘Anywhere Door’ to hop on a writing
        adventure, where every page turn will take you to endless possibilities. Prepare
        your wits and pick up your pens for a day of uproarious wordplay and refined
        creativity in this war of words.
