    <h2>Writeup</h2>
    <blockquote><pre>
        As Michelangelo once breathed life into marble and pigment, so too shall you
        breathe life into the abstract concept of time, transforming it into tangible, palpable
        creations that echo through the ages. Channel Da Vinci's spirit as you explore the
        depths of the temporal landscape, weaving together past, present, and future in a
        mesmerizing tapestry of color and form. Just like Loki said, “I can rewrite the
        story”, you can carve and visualize your own story.
