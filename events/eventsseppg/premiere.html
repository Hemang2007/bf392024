    <h2>Writeup</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <pre>
        Lights, Camera and Action!! Bring your movie-making magic to the silver screen,
        give the audience a hair-raising, edge of the seat experience like Rambo and John
        Wick or baffle the masses with a Nolanesque thriller, making generations debate if
        the top is still spinning or not. Will you leave your beloved watchers devastated
        over Iron Man's death or hanging off the edge of a cliff wondering why Katappa
        killed Bahubali?
