    <h2>Writeup</h2>
    <blockquote><pre>
        Picture a timeless classic like the Coca-Cola ad, but with polar bears wearing VR
        headsets and doing the floss dance. Or perhaps a nod to the iconic "Mac vs. PC"
        campaign, reimagined with a time-traveling twist where PCs from the past clash
        with futuristic Macs.
        Here, the skip ad button is only a cowardly escape and where you can use all the
        quirky references you need to remove the saying, “Ads kaun dekhta hai”.

    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <blockquote><pre>
        Number of Participants - 5+2 (for technical assistance) 
        Duration - 5+2 minutes (including setup) 
        Round 1: 
        ● Each school will be allotted a unique scenario and they have to come up with an effective ad spoof to positively impact their 
        influence, brand value, reach, etc. 
        ● The schools must get their own props for the acts. 
        ● English shall be the only medium of communication during the course of the event. Obscenity, abusive language, vulgarity,
         of any kind will lead to disqualification
         ● Topics will be chosen by the school reps by lucky draw on the day of rep meet.
