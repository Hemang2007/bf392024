    <blockquote><pre>
        They say a magician never reveals his secrets, so weave your magic through the
        intricate tapestry of the ecosystem and conceive solutions to climate change. Your
        ideas may just hold the power to stop Armageddon and prevent the collapse of
        civilization as we know it. Use your ingenuity and brainstorm solutions for
        problems to be faced by 31st Century humans (if we survive another millenia).
        This is your opportunity to determine whether our future will be a utopia or a
        dystopia.
