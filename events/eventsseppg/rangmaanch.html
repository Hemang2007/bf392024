        "All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players."
        Welcome to Bosco Rangmanch, where the streets transform into stages and every
        corner becomes a canvas for storytelling. So, join us as we embark on a journey
        through the ages, where each performance will serve as a window into the past, a
        reflection of the present, or a glimpse into the infinite possibilities of the future.
