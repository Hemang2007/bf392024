        <pre>
        From Superman to Spiderman, the greatest heroes all have a journalist secret
        identity. Here, flip the tables and unveil your inner superhero as you deliver
        breaking news at warp speed. Will you grant a red-pill-like awakening or keep the
        masses indoctrinated under the propaganda of the Machines? Will you be just
        another part of the overpowering system or break free of the clutches of our AI
        Overlords - There is no such thing as bad publicity, right?
