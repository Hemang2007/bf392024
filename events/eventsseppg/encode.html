        "Step into our coding extravaganza where bytes meet brilliance! Channel your
        inner Tony Stark as we hack through the space-time continuum, as we delve into
        the world where Elon Musk's algorithms and Sheldon Cooper's meticulousness
        converge. Inspired by the efficiency of and the precision of Tim Berners-Lee's
        code, we're exploring the realm where lines of code shape the future. With the
        precision of 'The Matrix' and the ingenuity of 'The Social Network,' let's craft
        solutions that transcend time itself.

    <blockquote>

        Participants: 2

        ROUND 1:  (35+5) minutes
        1.	The participants will be given a coding challenge, which is to be solved in 30 minutes. Before that,
         5 minutes of brainstorming is allowed after the questions are given. After brainstorming, the participants will be given access to the machines.
        2.	Both the participants have to participate in this round simultaneously.
        3.	Contestants have to write the programs in the following language:
        -	Python/Java
        -	C++
        4.	A program will be considered wrong if it fails to work on one or more of the test cases. It will otherwise
         be considered correct for the purposes of this contest. A correct program will be awarded the full points. In the event of
          a tie, programs will be awarded partial credits based on the number of tests correctly passed or the time recorded in ascending order.
        5.	Sample inputs will be provided to the participants.
        6.	The coding and the screenshots of the output to be saved in a folder.
        7.	Participants will not be allowed to access the internet for any purpose.
        8.	The method of submission of the code will be provided to the participants on the day of the event.
        
        
        ROUND 2: 10 minutes
        1.	Participants will be given a Google form link where they have to solve a quiz related to
         the historical and technological timeline of Computer Science.
        2.	Both participants have to brainstorm together.
        3.	Points will be awarded based on the number of correct replies or ties will be broken by the
         total time for each school in ascending order of time.
        4.	Use of the internet will be strictly prohibited in this round.
        
        
        
        ROUND 3: 20 minutes
        1.	Participants will be getting a topic about a futuristic proposed AI/ML Model which will be chosen
         randomly from a set of problem statements.
        2.	Access to the internet will be provided to frame the ideas. No coding is to be done in this round.
        3.	Participants will be given 4 minutes to present the same in front of the judges.
        4.	Original, realistic and implementable ideas will be encouraged and gradation will be done based on the judge's
         discretion. The participants may refer to any standard AI models as a point of reference.
