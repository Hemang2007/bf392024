    <h2>Writeup</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <pre>
            “Don't raise your voice, improve your argument”
            Step into the intellectual colosseum where words wield power and arguments are
            forged in the fires of reason. Feel the tension in the air as the clock ticks down,
            driving each contender toward their ultimate destiny. In this arena, wit is your
            weapon, and logic your shield, as you battle for supremacy in the realm of
            ideologies. You must maintain your stand the way Ross did when he said, “We
            were on a break!”
