    <h2>Writeup</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <pre>
        “Once you've eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable,
        must be the truth.” It's the only event where being an 'insufferable know-it-all'
        actually gives you an advantage. Pick your poison and find out if it's Socrates'
        Hemlock or Cleopatra's Viper, roll the dice to see if you will end up on the
        Stairway to Heaven or Highway to Hell and at the end of it all, you can proudly
        proclaim it was all “Elementary, My Dear Watson”.
